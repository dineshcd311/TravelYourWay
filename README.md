# TravelYourWay

We have designed a bus reservation system using API and connected it with the Database. 
There are around 120 buses running to and from, 5 major cities of Tamilnadu.
We have maintained a separate table in the Database for each bus in our agency.
Passenger details which are collected using GUI are stored in the Database and are conveniently retrieved. 
There are 10 pages to run the entire reservation system.
